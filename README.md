================

This is an experimental, mostly proof-of-concept application that adds "widgets" onto your WP7 lockscreen.

The source is a horrendous mess, as this application has to use some bizarre hacks to get around the OS memory and background lifetime restrictions.
As such, it's not really recommended to use as a daily application.
